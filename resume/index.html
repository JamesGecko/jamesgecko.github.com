<div class="job">
  <strong>Tapjoy</strong> - <em>Developer (September 2012 - June 2013)</em><br>
<div class="short">
    Helped maintain and write several features and tools for a large Rails application.
</div>
<div class="long">
    <p>
    I fixed internal pages that timed out, refactored a customer
    search function and added a new category of credit to account payments.
    </p>
    <p>
    I also wrote some tools to help develop and support the application.
    Examples included building a way to execute scheduled jobs immediately in
    a development environment, and overhauling our Vagrant setup.
    </p>
    <p>
    I was a member of a team which was building a Backbone.js application.
    Most of us did both frontend and backend work. I assisted with a
    read-only api powered by Rails. In particular, I was involved with data
    filtering, Jbuilder templates, Apipie powered documentation/parameter
    validation, and fetching statistics. On the frontend, I wrote a filtering
    UI, a data binder for fields and models, miscellaneous models and views,
    and some Handlebars and Sass.

      </li>
      <li>

    </ul>

    <p><strong>Minor projects</strong></p>

      <li>
        A system which updated Jabber statuses when users used their

        plugin for the Prosody Jabber server, and
        <a href="https://github.com/JamesGecko/ReplayBot" rel="nofollow">a Python Twisted bot</a>
        which announced status changes in a chatroom.

<div class="job">
  <strong>AbiSource</strong> - <em>Google Summer of Code Student Intern (May - August 2009)</em><br>
  <div class="short">
    Did initial work implementing double buffering using the Cairo graphics
    library in the open source word processor AbiWord.
  </div>
  <div class="long">
    This was so the multi-page rendering feature wouldn't flicker when zoomed
    out on complex documents.  I got it to about the halfway mark by the end
    of Summer and learned a lot about Cairo, GDB, and Valgrind.

<div class="job">
  <strong>AbiSource</strong> - <em>Google Summer of Code Student Intern (May - August 2008)</em><br>
  <div class="short">
    Coded a multi-page view feature that is in the AbiWord stable release.
  </div>
  <div class="long">
    <p>
      This feature allowed the user to view multiple pages at a time when
      they zoomed out far enough. It was shipped in AbiWord 2.8.0. A screenshot
      may be viewed at <a href="/uploads/abiword-multipage.png">http://jamesgecko.com/uploads/abiword-multipage.png</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the AbiSource people are scattered all over the world, I worked
      online. This involved writing code with the #abiword chatroom open in
      the background. Once a week or so I'd have a meeting with my mentor and
      he would point me toward the next place in the codebase to hack on.
