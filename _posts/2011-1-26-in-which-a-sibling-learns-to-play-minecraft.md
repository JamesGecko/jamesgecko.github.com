title: In which a sibling learns to play Minecraft
---
 
I set my younger brother Matthew up playing Minecraft yesterday.

First, WASD-style controls are a mystery to him. Even after explanation, he moves around using only the W key and mouselook.

Matthew: Hey look! I found a goat.

James: What? There aren't any goats in this game...

Goat: SSSSSssss.

James: Aaaaah! That's not a goat! Run!
