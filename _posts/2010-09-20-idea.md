Suddenly I had a great idea for the software I was writing. I was like, "All my scratch paper is full. Sticky notes aren't big enough. What will I do? I must capture this burst of genius before it escapes." There was a napkin on the desk. "Sweet, I'll sketch on the back of a napkin. I've always wanted to do this. Behold, the birth of a great idea." Crumbs scattered across the desk as the napkin was flipped in preparation. Then I learned the terrible truth. Gel pens work horribly on napkins.
