I like simple things. Wordpress? Isn't simple. I don't need a database to store all my posts in. Simple is not necessarily easy or fast, but it is flexible. So I've ported my blog over to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). It'll let me manage static pages with it easily, which means absolutely nothing to anybody, but it makes me feel warm and fuzzy. I also broke a lot of URLs, but my gut tells me that nobody cares about that either. Because if I don't write much, nobody tends to read it. Yanking things around wildly so I feel like writing is thus more productive than being a perfectionist and not writing anything.

So, right. If you're reading this, things look different than they used to and the mission is a success.
