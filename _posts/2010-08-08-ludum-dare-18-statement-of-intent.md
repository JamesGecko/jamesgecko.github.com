title: Ludum Dare 18 Statement of Intent
---
 
Ludum Dare is a 48 hour game making competition. The theme this round is "Enemies as weapons." [I'm participating!](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/author/jamesgecko)

So, yes. Make a complete game in a weekend. Can't be that hard, right? [Cactus](http://cactusquid.com/games.htm) does it all the time...
