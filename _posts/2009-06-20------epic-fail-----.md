Perhaps you've heard of that exciting new filesystem called ext4. Perhaps you're a MORON who knows the risks and runs it on your primary system anyway. Perhaps your laptop battery dies every now and than.

Well, hey. Would you look at that?

<h1>EPIC FAIL!</h1>
"Wait, what's this?" you say. Let me help you understand.

That folder marked lost+found? That is the only folder in the root directory of my primary hard disk. All those numbered files inside? That's my system files, my program files, my documents, my 500+ tomboy note collection, my music, ALL my class work for the past three years, and almost every line of code I've ever written. File #132067 is my FAFSA confirmation from last year.

I am an <em>idiot</em>.

Not a complete idiot, mind you. I have a little on my Windows partition, and I do back up what I'm currently working on. Thank God for Dropbox.

But still. This fails.
